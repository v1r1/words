welcome to words. this site is intended to be a place for me to write and host different articles, opinion pieces and reviews. I plan to keep this site basic, with the focus being on the writing. 

I am hosting the site through GitHub Pages and using Jekyll to build the site. If you have an issues with the site, it would help a lot if you can report them on the GitHub repo at the URL below:

I'm using a custom Jekyll theme I created based around my XYZ theme collection. It can be found on the jekyll branch of my XYZ repo:
#### [github.com/viri-space/XYZ/tree/jekyll](https://github.com/viri-space/XYZ/tree/jekyll)
