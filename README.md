<h1 align="center">Words</h1>

welcome the GitHub repo for words. this site is intended to be a place for me to write and host different articles, opinion pieces and reviews. I plan to keep this site basic, with the focus being on the writing.

I am hosting the site through GitHub Pages and using Jekyll to structure the site. If you have any issues with the site, feel free to let me know by opening an issue here on the repo. I also have a separate repo with my own personal Jekyll theme on it.

visit the site here:
