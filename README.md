welcome to words. this site is intended to be a place for me to write and host different articles, opinion pieces and reviews. I plan to keep this site basic, with the focus being on the writing.

I am hosting the site through GitHub Pages and using Jekyll to structure the site. I have a separate repo with my own personal Jekyll theme on it.

visit the site here:
## [words.viri.space](https://words.viri.space)

the repo for the sites theme can be found here:
## [github.com/viri-space/XYZ/tree/jekyll](https://github.com/viri-space/XYZ/tree/jekyll)
