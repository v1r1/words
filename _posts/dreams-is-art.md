Recently I picked up Dreams on the PS4. The game is in development at Media Molecule who you might know as the creators of Little Big Planet. While the game is still in early access and no official story mode has been released, it already has tons of beautifully made user created content ready for people to experience. I was surprised to find just how much had been made inside of the game already during this early stage.
