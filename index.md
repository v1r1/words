this is the index page, might replace with a list of posts at some point.

welcome to words. this site is intended to be a place for me to write and host different articles, opinion pieces and reviews. I plan to keep this site basic, with the focus being on the writing.

I am hosting the site through GitHub Pages and using Jekyll to structure the site. I have a separate repo with my own personal Jekyll theme on it.
